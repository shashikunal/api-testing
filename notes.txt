What is web services?

A web service is any piece of software is available over the network (internet) and uses s standardized XML messaging System 

1 : ALL web services are API's 
2 : web service only be hosted on web server (CLOUD) (INTERNET ****************)
3 : LOCAL web server will not work with web service 
4 : a web service uses limited communication like SOAP , REST , XMP-RPC 
5 : web service is interaction between servers over an internet(network)


API 
    An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another

1 : ALL api's are NOT web services
2 : API can be hosted with Application(LOCAL server) or cloud server (internet)
3 : API may use any style of communication like SOAP , REST , GRAPhQL , desktop app , android , 
4 : APi as an interface between two Applications


Similarities between API and WEB SERVICE 

BOTH are accessed through HTTP/HTTPS to enable communication between  service provider and consumer
BOTH are call a function , process the data and receive a response from provider 


SOAP and REST and XML-RPC
WEB SERVICE is standard GIVEN by W3c(World Wide Web Consortium)

before web service 
1 : CORBA 
2 : DCOM (microsoft and IBM)
3 : RMI (SUN micro system)

4 // !WEB SERVICE is standard GIVEN by W3c(World Wide Web Consortium)



WEB SERVICE IMPLEMENTED WITH IN TWO WAYS 
1 : SOAP  => SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL => medium => HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol) format => XML
2 : REST  => REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER => medium => HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol) format => xml , json , csv , anything ....


DESCRIBE web service 
//!================================SOAP WEB SERVICE ================================/
SOAP service 
   = >  It is PROTOCOL  for designing web services over an HTTP , FTP , ....
    WSDL => WEB SERVICE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE 
            STANDARD FORMAT FOR DESCRIBING A WEB SERVICE 
            DEVELOPED BY MICROSOFT AND IBM
   WSDL IS AN XML BASED PROTOCOL FOR EXCHANGING DATA BETWEEN SERVERS 
   UDDI => universal description discovery Integration
        xml based worldwide business registry

        UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. It provides a directory of Web-services interfaces (written in WSDL). It uses SOAP for queries and modifications.
=> FORMATE SHOULD BE XML ONLY
=> MEDIUM LIKE HTTP , SMTP , FTP
=> calling by RPC(remote procedure call)
=> performance slow 
=> WSDL => UDDI => fro communication between provider and consumer

//!================================RESTfull WEB SERVICE ================================/

RESTfull WEB SERVICES ***************

   => It is an architecture style for designing web services over an HTTP/HTTPS
   => RESTfull web service doesn't  enforce any rule ....
   => FORMATE like XML , JSON , CSV , TEXT .........
   => MEDIUM SHOULD BE HTTP/HTTPS
   => CALLING BY URL PATH (example for url www.google.com)
   => USEs JSON or xml for communication send or receive
   performance better 
   90% companies are using REST web service


  ***interview 
   !Architectural Constraints
    RESTFULL WEB SERVICE defines 6 Architectural Constraints
    1 : client-server 
        This constraint essentially means that client application and server application MUST be able to evolve separately without any dependency on each other. A client should know only resource URIs, and thatâ€™s all.

    2 : Uniform interface 
    3 : stateless 
    4 : cacheable 
    5 : layered System
    6 : code on demand(optional)
